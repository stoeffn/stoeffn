# Projects

**This where I'd like to showcase my projects. There is much more to come—stay tuned!**

I'll probably write about these in the future:

* StudAppServer—a _Kitura_ server that powers [studapp.stoeffn.de](https://studapp.stoeffn.de)
* [Scomo](https://scomo.de/)—web platform and native apps with personalized timetables and substitution schedules for students and teachers
* [Pseudo](https://github.com/stoeffn/Pseudo)—proof-of-concept transpiler for a pseudo language implemented in _Objective-C_
* [stoeffn](https://github.com/stoeffn/stoeffn)—how this very website is made
* SkyScan—an mass-photometry tool
