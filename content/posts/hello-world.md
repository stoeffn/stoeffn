Hey there, welcome to my website!

As this is very first post, please let me introduce myself: I'm _Steffen_, a _German_ computer science student, and I love coding, especially in _Swift_ or for _Apple_ platforms.

## What to Expect

Okay, this is my first attempt at blogging. That's why I'm not entirely sure either.

Basically, I want to share what I've learned or experienced as well as problems I encountered. But most of it will be programming-related. And I'd also love showcase some of my projects.

## Why "Stoeffn"?

Why---out of all possible letter combinations---did I choose _stoeffn_? Basically (when pronounced in _German_), it sounds like my first name, which I found quite funny. Plus, it available as a username on almost all platforms, which is pretty convenient. So I stuck with it.

## How It's Made

If you like this site's design, feel free to check out and explore its [source code](https://github.com/stoeffn/stoeffn)!

Since it is not supposed to have any dynamic content, I've decided to [Go Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Hugo is popular static site generator that strives for simplicity and performance. It offers powerful templating as well as easy content management with a simple format loved by many developers: Markdown.

The generated source code at `public` lives in its own repository and its contents are hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), making it easy to manage.

As a final layer, I use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) for DNS management, caching, and SSL encryption.

If you want to find out more, I would like to encourage you to check [Hugo's QuickStart Guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) or my project's [README](https://github.com/stoeffn/stoeffn/blob/master/README.md).
